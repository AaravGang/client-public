Online Tic Tac Toe and Connect4.

## Setup

If you dont have python3 installed, then go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install `python3.8` or `python3.9`. cuz I'm not sure if it'll work on other versions.

Once you have that, download this client folder's zip on your `Desktop` and unzip it. (It will prolly be named `client-public-main`, rename it to `client`)

Next, Open a new terminal or command prompt, and paste in the following commands:

```
cd Desktop/client
```

üëÜüèª This will switch your current directory to the client folder.

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the dependencies required to play the game. **Use only `python` instead of `python3` on Windows**

## Play the game

### Run the client.py file by:

```
python3 client.py
```
on mac

OR
```
python client.py
```
on windows

The client will ask for the server's details, paste them in (right click), and you'll be good to go!
